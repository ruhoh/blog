# Usage: http://ruhoh.com

# This helps parsers (and hosting platforms) determine which version is needed to compile your site.
# If you compile your blog yourself, setting this won't matter, but it's a nice thing to keep updated.
RuhohSpec: "2.1"

# Used for things like RSS that need the full URL to a given resource.
# This DOES NOT affect any of your paths or links in any way.
# This DOES NOT configure domain mapping. See post2.ruhoh.com for hosting options.
production_url: "http://sample.com"

# Intelligently prepends all urls in the system with the given base_path.
# This allows you to host your blog in a subdirectory of a given website.
# Example:
#  To host at the path: http://myuniversity.edu/staff/me/~/blog.
#  set base_path: "/staff/me/~/blog"
# NOTE: base_path is never added in development mode (for convenience).
base_path: "/"

# Tell ruhoh which folder will model the "theme"
twitter :
  # Tells ruhoh which collection class to use for this folder.
  # Here we use "theme" which makes this folder the theme.
  use : "theme"

# Enable the asset pipeline to process stylesheets and javascripts using sass, coffeescript, etc.
# The asset pipeline supports live preview + bundling/minification on compile.
# Sprockets is used for the ruby version: https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets#readme
#
# To Enable:
#   1. Set enable to true.
#   2. Update Gemfile to include the sprockets and supporting processor gems.
#
# It's done this way because some users just want to write a freaking blog post
# and have no need for a billion gems -- hopefully you agree with me =)
