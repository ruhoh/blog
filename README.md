A default blog scaffold for **ruhoh** compatible static blog parsers.

See <http://ruhoh.com> for more information.

## Usage and Documentation

See <http://ruhoh.com/usage> for full usage and documentation.

Currently the only parser is available in ruby as a ruby gem:

````bash
$ gem install ruhoh
$ ruhoh help
````

Once you have the gem you can run your blog locally:

````bash
$ git clone git://github.com/ruhoh/blog.git USERNAME.ruhoh.com
$ cd USERNAME.ruhoh.com
$ rackup -9292
````
