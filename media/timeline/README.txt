A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/christian-fei/pen/BJily.

 This is an experiment for an (upcoming) feature on my blog (christian-fei.com)
The posts will be shown in a timeline, from the newest to the oldest post.
Another cool feature is that it is fully responsive, although with some minor bugs, like the arrows won't show on narrow screens
